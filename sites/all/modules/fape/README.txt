This module adds a contextual link to Panel Panes that are entity
fields allowing fields to be edited directly.

To make use of this module, first enable the module. Then enable
Panels and on a panel that has an entity context, add any field.
Users who have access to edit that field on that entity and have
contextual links access will see a little contextual link allowing
them to edit that field in the overlay (or on a separate screen
if they do not have overlay access).

This module does not have a true dependency on Panels. If you enable
it without Panels it will not appear to do anything, but the edit
links are still usable and other modules may implement them.
